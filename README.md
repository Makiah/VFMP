# Vector Field Motion Profiling
âž¡ An original take on motion profiling, by overlaying vector fields.  

This module contains tools for generating these fields, as well as a HTML5/JS viewing utility.  I'll probably make this a submodule at some point, once it works effectively.  

From what I can gather, path generation is as easy as saying
```
y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d
F_x(x, y) = (-dy/dx + 1)(-y + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) + x solved for y
F_y(x, y) = (-dx/dy + 1)(-y + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) + y solved for x
```

## Improved Work

Now uses derivative as a coefficient for more advanced correction
